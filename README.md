# PRODIGY DATA SCIENCE TASK 1
Completed **PRODIGY_DS_01** as part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. I worked with bar charts and histograms in Python to analyze categorical and continuous data like age and gender, focusing on identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies. This task strengthened my understanding of choosing the right visualizations and communicating insights clearly through data.
