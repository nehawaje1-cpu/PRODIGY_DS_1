# PRODIGY DATA SCIENCE
Completed PRODIGY_DS_01 during my Data Science internship at Prodigy InfoTech. I visualized categorical and continuous data using bar charts and histograms to study distributions like age and gender. This task improved my skills in choosing the right visuals, analyzing patterns, and communicating insights clearly using Python.
